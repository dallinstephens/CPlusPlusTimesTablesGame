### What I am trying to accomplish as a Software Developer
As a Software Developer, I am developing the ability to learn new programming languages quickly to solve problems and create solutions. My focus as a developer is to implement programs with an appealing visual look for the user.

### Description of Software
This is a C++ program that creates a times tables game. It is an educational game to help young students and others learn their times tables. The times tables game includes 1 up through 12. To make the game more user friendly, I created a graphical window interface using SFML which works in conjuction with C++.

### Video Demo
This video demonstrates my running code and how the game works.

# Development Environment

* C++
* SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Libary)
* Visual Studio Code
* GitHub / Git
* WinLibs with GCC and MinGW-w64

# Future Work

- An improvement for this game would be to add features to have the user work up through levels from easier to harder.
- When a user completes a level, there could be features that celebrate what the user has accomplished so far. 
- With this game, I could have the squares change colors with each new level. I could also have the color of the squares be the same color for each level.
- I could also add features where the user could go back to the menu window.
- The file organization and installation could be cleaned up a bit.
